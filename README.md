# üåç GeoZone
GeoZone - a QGIS python plugin allowing to track zones with specific animal diseases


## GeoZone Plugin for QGIS

The GeoZone plugin is a tool designed for QGIS users to streamline the management of geographic zones within spatial data. This plugin simplifies tasks related to creating, editing, and storing information about geographic zones, such as disease outbreak areas, wildlife habitats, or quarantine zones.

## Features

### 1. GeoZone Layer Management

The plugin introduces a dedicated layer, GeoZone_Layer, to manage geographic zones efficiently. If the layer doesn't exist, the plugin creates an empty one or loads an existing layer at a default location.

### 2. Copying Selected Geometries

Users can easily copy selected geometries from other layers to the GeoZone_Layer. This feature is useful for aggregating specific geographic zones into a centralized layer.

### 3. Metadata Entry

The plugin prompts users to provide metadata for each saved GeoZone_Layer. Metadata includes essential attributes like operation type, country code, local identifier, and accuracy. Users can also add additional metadata fields as needed.

### 4. Custom Dialog for Editing Attributes

When selecting features from the GeoZone_Layer, the plugin now displays a custom dialog for each feature. This dialog allows users to modify attributes, excluding 'optype' and 'uuid', providing a more intuitive editing experience.

### 5. Zip File Export

After saving the GeoZone_Layer and its metadata, the plugin conveniently zips all related files (shapefile, metadata JSON, etc.) into a single zip file. This helps users maintain a tidy and organized folder structure for their geographic zone data.
